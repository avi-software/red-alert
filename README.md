## Description
Red Alert it is application that lets you get real-time alert when the red alert sounded in Israel. This is an unofficial application.

It is written QML by QT.

### Note  
Currently i don't find the way to send notification to the user, or to the notification menu.  
maybe i can't do it on the current version of the **Ubuntu Phone**.
